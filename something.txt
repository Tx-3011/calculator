Project/Exercise: Calculator

(I didn't add the "=" functionality yet, to evaluate just press any operator)

Issue/Problem: it Can do same operator calculations but not multiple like 5+1+3 it will do but not 1+1-2, I think the problem is that when I click an operator then only the value is stored, like when I do 5 +(5 stored) 3 +(5 stored and calculated to 8) the code sums stuff only when there are two values, so when I do 5 + 3 - 2, it is taking the plus sign just to store the value and actually performing the calculation after clicking - so it's doing 5-3
